% *PLOTS*
% 
% Simple plots are easily created by passing arrays to the *plot()* function. 
% When passing a single array y as plot(y), Matlab will generate a graph with 
% the array index values on the x-axis, and the corresponding array values on 
% the y-axis:

theta = (-1:.01:1)*pi;
y = sin(theta);
plot(y)
%% 
% When passing two arrays x and y as plot(x,y) the resulting graph will contain 
% points with coordinates x(i) and y(i) for each index i in the arrays:

clf               % clears the plot window
plot(theta,y)
%% 
% Note that arrays theta and y must have the same length
% 
% By default, each pair of (theta,y) values is shown as a single dot on the 
% graph, and Matlab draws a line connecting the dots *in sequence*, which can 
% lead to unexpected results if the point pairs are not properly ordered:

x = [-8 -5 0 0  5 8];    % increasing x values
y = [ 5 -8 8 8 -8 5];
plot(x,y)
%% 
% vs:

x = [0 -5 8 -8  5 0];    % same x,y pairs, but different order
y = [8 -8 5  5 -8 8];
plot(x,y)
%% 
% Try another example:

x = (-1:.01:1)*pi;
y = sin(x);
plot(x,y)
%% 
% By default, the plot linearly interpolates between x,y data points.
% 
% Can plot just the data points using a third argument in plot():

plot(x,y,'.')
%% 
% A variety of point markers are available, like triangles:

plot(x,y,'>')
%% 
% Draw the data with markers, *and* the interpolated line between points

plot(x,y,'>-')
%% 
% Chage the color of markers and lines ("r","g","b","k", etc colors)

plot(x,y,'r>-')
%% 
% Control the line style (dashed "--", dotted ":", etc)

plot(x,y,'r>--')
%% 
% Combine multiple plots in a single function call:

plot(x,y,'x', x-2.5,y.^2,'o')
%% 
% Many combinations of colors, markers, and linestyles, check the help file 
% for details:

help plot
%% 
% 
% 
% *Formatting plots*
% 
% Adding grids, axis labels, and titles (note the "see also" options under "help 
% plot"):

plot(x,y)
grid
xlabel('x')
ylabel('sin(x)')
title('Plot of sin(x)');
%% 
% The range for each axis can be specified using the axis command, with syntax: 
% axis([XMIN XMAX YMIN YMAX])

axis([-2 2 -1.5 3])
%% 
% Each new plot command will completely overwrite previous plot and formatting.  
% To keep the previous plot, put new plot in a different "figure" window.
% 
% Create a new figure window and put a different plot in it:

figure(2)
plot(x, sin(2*x))
%% 
% Figures can be saved to different graphics formats (png, pdf, etc.).
% 
% We won't do a lot with multiple figure windows in this class but the functionality 
% is there to open up as many different figure windows as you like, with different 
% plots on each.
% 
% To "redirect" subsequent plots to a specific, already open figure window, 
% type *figure(n)* before the next plot command, where "n" is the number of the 
% window you want to use.  If a window with that number doesn't exist, a new window 
% will be opened and given the number indicated by "n".
% 
% Get rid of an unneeded figure window with the close command

close(2)
%% 
% We can also close all figure windows:

close all
%% 
% As we saw previously, multiple plots can be placed in a single figure by specifying 
% 2 (or more) x-y datasets in a single plot command:

plot(x, y, x, sin(2*x))
%% 
% Can control the color and linestyle of each plot separately:

plot(x, y, 'r-', x, sin(2*x), 'k:')
%% 
% Can alternately use "hold on" to tell Matlab to keep the previous plot in 
% a window in order to overlay an additional plot onto it at a later time

plot(x,y)
hold on
plot(x, sin(2*x))
%% 
% Use "hold off" to revert to original plot behavior (replacing the old plot 
% completely when a new plot command is given)

hold off
plot(x,y)  % plot from above is replaced entirely here
hold on
plot(x, sin(2*x), 'r') % different colored plot overlaid
plot(x, sin(3*x), 'm') % yet another plot overlaid; 3 total now
hold off
%% 
% To make the graph have one color, and the data points another, plot twice 
% with hold on:

plot(x,y,'g.')  % draw the original graph
hold on
plot(x(1:4:end),y(1:4:end),'b>') % Mark every 4th datum a different color
%% 
% Clear a figure without removing the window with "clf":

clf
%% 
% Multiple *independent* plots can also be created in a single figure window 
% using the "subplot" command. You are not responsible for this in ENME202, but 
% it is a useful command to be aware of:

help subplot
%% 
% 
% 
% *A final note:*
% 
% Matlab plots are extremely powerful, and we are just touching the surface 
% here. There is a wide variety of 2D and 3D plot options, and your code can also 
% manipulate plots at a very  low level using more advanced commands than covered 
% here.
