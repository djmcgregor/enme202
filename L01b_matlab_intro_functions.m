% 
% *INTRODUCTION*
% 
% 
% 
% *MATLAB INTERFACE*
% 
% Current Folder: Displays Matlab files ("m-files" or scripts) in the current 
% directory.
% 
% Editor: Built-in editor for writing m-files. You can copy & paste from a plain 
% text file.
% 
% Command Window: Use to directly enter any Matlab command. You can run an m-file 
% from this window by entering the file name, provided the file directory is part 
% of your path.
% 
% Workspace: Shows all currently active variables
% 
% *RUNNING MATLAB THROUGH UMD VIRTUAL LAB*
% 
% Installing a native version of Matlab is recommended! However, if you are 
% unable to install Matlab on your computer for any reason, Matlab can run without 
% being installed by using the Virtual Computer Lab: http://virtlab.eng.umd.edu
% 
% When using Virtual Lab, always save your files to the U: volume to ensure 
% that your code will remain available after closing the current Citrix session
% 
% *HELP COMMANDS:*
%% 
% * help      --> local help file
% * lookfor   --> search local help files for keyword
% * doc       --> online help file
% * docsearch --> search online docs for keyword
%% 
% Help topics are organized by classes of operators and functions.In addition 
% to the core language elements under the "matlab" topic, specific help is also 
% available for different packages (simulink, control, curvefit, etc.) available 
% in Matlab.

% help            % view all available topics (now deprecated...)
% help lang       % view a summary of built-in programming language constructs
% help if         % view details on "if" statement usage
% help helptools  % view all available help tools
%% 
% "doc" will display the HTML document page for a given topic, often with more 
% discussion and examples than the help page. When available, the document page 
% can also be accessed from a link to the "Reference page" at the bottom of the 
% help page:

% doc if    % bring up document page for the "if" conditional statement
%% 
% "lookfor" / "docsearch" will display a list of local / online help files containing 
% the desired term:

lookfor dot

% *BASIC ARITHMETIC AND COMPUTATIONAL ERROR*
% 
% Typing a mathematical expression in the command window will yield a result, 
% similar to the functionality of a calculator:
% 
% Basic arithmetic (+, -)

2+2
2-2
%% 
% Multiplication (*)

2*3
%% 
% Exponentiation (^) (caret)

2^3
%% 
% Fractional powers

2^0.5
%% 
% Increase number of significant digits displayed

format long
2^0.5
%% 
% Go back to default number of sig digits

format short
sqrt(2)
%% 
% There is a finite precision with which numbers can be represented, leading 
% to rounding errors:

sqrt(2)^2 - 2   % Should be zero, but...
%% 
% eps (epsilon) is the smallest significand (decimal part) difference that Matlab 
% can represent

format long
eps         % ans = 2.220446049250313e-016
%% 
% Matlab uses the international standard IEEE 754 for "high" precision representation 
% of decimal numbers. This standard uses 52 bits to represent the significand.  
% There are thus "gaps" between the numbers of length:

1 / 2^52    % ans = 2.220446049250313e-016
%% 
% (this result is exactly the value of eps)
% 
% Two numbers whose significand differs by less than eps (after rounding) are 
% identical to the computer.  For example, (1+eps/2) is rounded down to nearest 
% representable number, 1:

(1+eps/2) - 1
%% 
% Here, (1+2*eps/3) is rounded up to nearest representable number, 1+eps:

(1+2*eps/3) - 1
%% 
% Let's try

(1-1)+eps/2   % same as (1+eps/2) - 1, but with the parentheses moved
%% 
% Note: (1+eps/2)-1 produces 0 but (1-1)+eps/2 produces eps/2!
% 
% This shows that the round-off error should be thought of in a "relative" sense 
% (relative to the numbers involved in the calculation).
% 
% Just to confirm this, try

1e-30 - 1e-31
%% 
% Clearly Matlab can take differences (and multiplication, etc.) of numbers 
% smaller than eps, so we need to think of the round-off error as "relative".
% 
% Note that successive calculations can *each* incur round-off error on the 
% order of eps, so large expressions or repeated calculations can build up significant 
% error if you are not careful!
% 
% 
% 
% *CORE FUNCTIONS*
% 
% *sqrt()* is one of the many built-in (core) functions in Matlab.
% 
% Each function does a mathematical calculation on the argument (input) being 
% passed to the function.  
% 
% *exp()* is Euler's number (e): e^x = exp(x) 

format short
exp(1)    % e^1 = e, so ans = 2.7183
%% 
% *log()* is log base e (equivalent to natural log; ln)

log(exp(1))    % log base e, so log(e) = 1
exp(log(8))
%% 
% Just for fun, what is exp(log(8))-8?

exp(log(8)) - 8     % ans = -1.7764e-15 = -8*eps
%% 
% log10() is log base 10

log10(8)
10^(log10(8))
%% 
% Absolute value

abs(-2)
%% 
% Trigonometric functions (arguments in radians)

sin(30 * pi/180)
%% 
% Append a "d" to the function name to work in degrees

sind(30)
%% 
% Note that pi is pre-defined

pi    % ans = 3.1416
%% 
% List all elementary math functions
