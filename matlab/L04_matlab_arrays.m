% 
% Like scalar numbers, an array of values can be assigned to a variable.  Here 
% we define a 4 element array:

x = [1 3 5 6]
%% 
% All of the numbers in the square brackets are now associated with the variable 
% "x", which now holds a list (array) of 4 numbers, instead of a single number. 
% 
% Can use real or complex numbers, mathematical expressions, or existing variables 
% to specify the elements of an array. Matlab will work out the numerical values 
% for any expressions in the brackets, then associate these numbers with the given 
% variable name:

a = -1;
y = [1+2j  sqrt(-2)  a  exp(a)]
%% 
% Default "orientation" of an array is horizontal (row), but we can convert 
% a horizontal (row) array to a vertical (column) array using the *transpose operator: 
% '* (apostrophe)

x = [1 3 5 6]'
%% 
% Alternately, *semicolons* can be used to create individual rows when first 
% defining the array. The following will yield a column array:

z = [1;3;5;6]
%% 
% Transpose is a "toggle" which turns rows into columns and vice-versa. The 
% following statements are all equivalent:

z = [1 3 5 6]
z = [1;3;5;6]'
z = [1 3 5 6]''   % double transpose
%% 
% IMPORTANT: for complex-valued arrays, the ' operator also yields the complex 
% conjugate!

x = [1 2+3i]
x'          % yields [1; 2-3i]
%% 
% To prevent Matlab from taking the conjugate, add a dot in front of the ' operator 
% ( *.'* )

x.'         % yields [1; 2+3i]
%% 
% 
% 
% *ARRAY INDEXING*
% 
% Access a specific value stored in an array by "indexing", i.e. indicating 
% which position in the array you want to look at.  The index is in parentheses 
% after the variable name, and indicates the numbered position in the list for 
% the value you want to work with.
% 
% In Matlab, we start counting array elements at 1 (unlike C++ and many other 
% languages where counting starts at 0 instead):

z = [-10  5  0.54]

z(1)  % 1st element of the array --> -10
z(2)  % --> 5
z(3)  % --> 0.54

%z(4)  % Error: Index exceeds the number of array elements
%z(0)  % Error: Array indices must be positive integers or logical values
%z(1.5)% Error: Array indices must be positive integers or logical values
%% 
% We can change values stored in a specific position in an array:

z(2) = pi;
z
%% 
% _As an aside, we can use the *disp()* function to define how the variable 
% z (or any other value) should be displayed:_

disp("z = " + z)
%% 
% _Here we seem to be "adding" a string and a complex value, but Matlab is smart 
% enough to recognize that the value held by z should be converted into a string 
% before combining the result with our "z = " string for display._
% 
% Any individual element of an array can be used just like an ordinary (non-array) 
% variable

asin(z(3))   % same as asin(0.54), since z(3) has value 0.54
%% 
% Length function tells how many values stored in an array 

length(z)   % returns 3
%% 
% "end" is a special index that means last element of the array

z(end)      % same as z(3) or z(length(z))
%% 
% Can do offsets from end to move "backwards" through the array

z(end-1)    % same as z(2)
%% 
% Variables can be used as indexes into an array, if they contain positive integers

k = 2;
z(k)

k = k+1;
z(k)
%% 
% Matlab will "grow" arrays if you assign values to elements that do not yet 
% exist:


x = [1;2;3;4]
x(5) = pi;
x
%% 
% x has now "grown" to be a 5 element column array.

x(8) = exp(1)
%% 
% Here Matlab has expanded x to be 8 elements, and set the 8th element to exp(1) 
% as specified.  The values of the 6th and 7th elements have not been specified, 
% and default to 0.
% 
% An empty array (null array):

x = []

length(x)     % returns 0
%% 
% 
% 
% *Colon notation* can be used to automatically create arrays whose values are 
% generated according to a specified linear sequence:

y = 2:5       % yields y = [2 3 4 5]
%% 
% The default increment is 1, but this can be changed by specifying a different 
% value between the limits.  For example, this generates an array from -3 to 1 
% in steps of 0.5:

z = -3:0.5:1
%% 
% All elementary functions operate on arrays by applying the function to every 
% element of the array seperately, and retuning a new array containing each result 
% in successive array elements:

q = 1:10
exp(-q)
sin(q)
sqrt(q)
%% 
% Scalar arithmetic works the same way (element-by-element):

2*q       % multiply every element in q by 2
q/2       % divide every element by 2
q+5       % add 5 to every element of q
q-3       % subtract 3 from every element of q
%% 
% More complex arithmetic operations are also possible:

2*q + q/5 - 8*sin(q) + 1
%% 
% 
% 
% *Multi-Array Operations*

x = 1:4               % row vector
y = [-2; -3; 0; 1]    % column vector
%% 
% You can add every element of one array to the corresponding elements of another 
% array, BUT the two arrays must have the *same dimensions* (both orientation 
% and length) to yield a new 1-D array of the sums.

x + y'      % x and y' are both row vectors -- ok!

x' + y      % x' and y are both column vectors -- ok!

x + y       % This will create a 4x4 matrix! Try it and see what happens
%% 
% Must be careful if we want to multiply or divide every element of one array 
% by those in another array.  You CANNOT use ordinary * for this, even if lengths 
% and orientations match:

%x * y'      % Error: Inner matrix dimensions must agree.
%% 
% Matlab thinks we want to do matrix multiplication (not element-by-element 
% multiplication), which requires that the *inner dimensions* of the arrays be 
% the same (we will discuss this topic in linear algebra review soon).
% 
% For element-by-element multiplication, we must use the special dot-star ( 
% *.** ) operator. The dot (.) tells Matlab that we want the given operation (*) 
% to be performed individually for each index across both arrays:

x .* y'     % [1*-2  2*-3  3*0  4*1] = [-2 -6 0 4]
%% 
% Similarly for division

x ./ y'     % [1/-2  2/-3  3/0  4/1] = [-0.5 -0.6667 Inf 4]

y ./ x'       % [-2/1  -3/2  0/3  1/4] = [-2 -1.5 0 0.25]
%% 
% Exponentiation is just iterated multiplication. Use the dot-caret ( *.^* ) 
% operator to raise every number in an array to a given power:

x.^2        % ans = [1 4 9 16]
%% 
% 
% 
% *Example â€“ Using arrays to evaluate a function over a range of values*: 
% 
% Generate the values of a function f(x) over a range of x values, given:   
% 
% f(x) = 2x^3 + 8x^2 + 12x + 8
% 
% (A) The wrong way
% 
% Let's start by doing the work "manually". First, create the range of x values:

x = -3:.01:1;
%% 
% How many values were created?

length(x)
%% 
% Find f(x) for the first value in the array x, and store this in the first 
% position of an array:

f(1) = 2*x(1)^3 + 8*x(1)^2 + 12*x(1) + 8      % note: x(1) = -3
%% 
% Note that "f(1)" is *not* f(x) when x = 1.  Instead, it is the value of f(x(1)), 
% where x(1) = -3.
% 
% Repeat for 2nd value of x:

f(2) = 2*x(2)^3 + 8*x(2)^2 + 12*x(2) + 8      % note: x(2) = -2.99
%% 
% Then the 3rd value, then the 4th...
% 
% This would be very tedious to repeat for all 401 values of x! 
% 
% (B) The right way
% 
% Now let's do it the proper way, using Matlab's array capabilities to generate 
% all 401 values for f(x) in a single step:

f = 2*x.^3 + 8*x.^2 + 12*x + 8;

length(f)       % same as length(x)
%% 
% Results agree with what we calculated manually for the first two x values:

f(1)   % ans = 10
f(2)   % ans = -9.8210
%% 
% 
% 
% *Other useful array functions*
% 
% The following functions return a single scalar value for a given array.

sum(x)    % Add all elements in array together
prod(x)   % Multiply all elements in array together:
mean(x)   % Average (mean) of all array elements, same as sum(x)/length(x)
std(x)    % Standard deviation of array elements
%% 
% 
% 
% *Min & Max*

min(x)    % Find the minimum of all elements in an array
max(x)    % Find the maximum of all elements in an array
%% 
% Both min() and max() *can* *also return the index* at which the given value 
% occurs. To extract the index, assign the result of the function to a 2-element 
% matrix: the first element will be the value, and the second element will be 
% the index.
% 
% A bit more advanced: how to get both the minimal value of a function f(x), 
% AND the value of the independent variable x at that minimum? Let's first make 
% a plot to visually see where the minimum occurs:

x = -3:.01:1; 
f = 8*x.^2 + 12*x + 8;
plot(x,f)
%% 
% Use min to get both the minimal value AND the position in the array where 
% this minimum occurs:

[fmin,imin] = min(f)    % yields fmin = 3.5, imin = 226
%% 
% So the minimal value of the f array is 3.5, and this happens at the 226th 
% index in the array.  What is the value of x at which f(x) = 3.5?  Simply look 
% at the 226th element of the x array to find the corresponding value:

x(imin)                 % ans = -0.7500
%% 
% So the minimum of f occurs at x = -0.75. Keep in mind that Matlab is working 
% with discrete values of x, so the true minimum of f(x) may be slightly different 
% that 3.5, and may occur at a value of x slightly different than -0.75.
% 
% 
% 
% *Searching arrays with find()*
% 
% A common challenge is to find the location of given values within an array. 
% We can use the Matlab *find()* function to do this.  For a 1-D array, find() 
% will return all of the indices where a given *Boolean statement* (logical comparison) 
% is true:

x = [3 8 8 6 3];

find (x == 3)
find (x < 6)
find (x >= 6)
find (x < 8 & x > 3)   % "&" means "logical and" -- more about this soon!
%% 
% 
% 
% *Array slicing*
% 
% We can "slice" arrays using an "array of indices":

y = [2 -9 3 0 8];
y_slice = y([1 2])        % ans = [2 -9]
%% 
% Pull out elements 4,2,5 (in that order):

y([4 2 5])      % ans = [0 -9 8]
%% 
% Pulling out contiguous slices using the colon notation:

y(1:3)
y(2:end)
y(end:-1:1)   % reverse the array!
%% 
% Changing multiple array elements:

y([1 3 7]) = [pi; 100; -10]
