% *ARRAYS AS VECTORS*
% 
% So far we have used arrays for two things:
%% 
% # holding a list of numbers
% # representing polynomials
%% 
% Another key use for Matlab arrays is to represent physical vectors, e.g. the 
% coordinates of a point or the components of a force or velocity. We often express 
% such vectors as column vectors, e.g.:


x = [1 0 -1]       % row vector
y = [1 2 3]'       % column vector
%% 
% Vector arithmetic works as expected:

x'+y     % addition (note the transpose to make dimensions match!)
x-y'     % subtraction
2*x     % scalar multiplication
%% 
% While we cannot multiply (or divide) a vector with another vector, there are 
% two important related operations that can be performed: the dot product and 
% cross product
% 
% Most functions will operate on an element-by-element basis, e.g.:

round(sqrt(x))
%% 
% 
% 
% *Norm:*
% 
% The norm() function yields the L2 norm (Euclidean norm), interpreted as the 
% vector length in n-dimensional space. This is not to be confused with length(), 
% which just gives the number of elements in an array!

norm(x)
%% 
% norm() is the same as:

sqrt(dot(x,x))
sqrt(x*x')
%% 
% *Dot product:*

dot(x,y)
dot(y,x)
dot(x,x)

%% 
% Manual calculation of dot(x,y):

x(1)*y(1) + x(2)*y(2) + x(3)*y(3)
%% 
% dot(x,y) = norm(x)*norm(y)*cos(q) where q = angle between x and y
% 
% A physical interpretation of the dot product is that dot(x,y) yields the length 
% of the projection of x onto y, multiplied by the length of y. This interpretation 
% allows us to determine the angle between two vectors:

q = acos(dot(x,y)/(norm(x)*norm(y))) 
%% 
% dot() does not care if the arrays are row vectors, column vectors, or a mix 
% of both:

dot(x',y)           % ans = -2
%% 
% 
% 
% *Cross product:*

cross(x,y)
cross(y,x)      % = -cross(x,y)
%% 
% A physical interpretation of the cross product is that the magnitude of cross(x,y) 
% is the area of a parallelogram with sides |x| and |y|, and the direction of 
% cross(x,y) is orthogonal to the plane containing the parallelogram:
% 
% cross(x,y) = |x| |y| sin(q)*n_hat
% 
% where n_hat is a unit normal vector orthogonal to x and y (using the right 
% hand rule). To find the plane in which x and y lie:

n_hat = cross(x,y)/(norm(x)*norm(y)*sin(q))   % q was found via dot(x,y)
%% 
% Note that n_hat has unit length:

norm(n_hat)
%% 
% Matlab can work with *any* length vector not just 2 or 3.  Indeed, you will 
% often need to deal with very large vectors in advanced engineering problems:

x=[1 -2 3 4 -5 7 9 -pi]'
y=(1:8)'
norm(x)
dot(x,y)        % length(x) must be same as length(y)
%% 
% Cross products, however, are ONLY defined between 3 dimensional vectors, so 
% cross(x,y) will not work here! The cross product _can_ be extended to n>3 dimensions, 
% but Matlab's cross() does not support this generalization.
% 
% 
% 
% *MATRICES*
% 
% Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers, that have their own special arithmetic 
% rules. Note that a vector can be viewed as a special case of a matrix containing 
% only a single row (or column, depending on orientation).
% 
% Define a matrix in Matlab by specifying the numbers in each row, separated 
% by spaces or commas. Start a new row with a semicolon

A = [1 2 3 -1; 4 5 6 0; 7 8 9 1]
%% 
% Can also put each row on a separate line (semicolons optional):

A = [ 1 2 3 -1
      4 5 6  0 
      7 8 9  1 ]
%% 
% This matrix A is 3x4 (3 rows, 4 columns)
% 
% When defining a matrix, *all* rows & columns must have the same number of 
% elements

% AA = [1 2 3 -1; 4 5 0; 7 8 9 1]      % ERROR
%% 
% Oops; 2nd row only had 3 elements in above, while the other two rows had 4.
% 
% Index into a matrix to get one of its elements by specifing both the row and 
% column number of the element
% 
% Element of A in 1st row, 3rd column:

r = 1;
c = 3;
A(r,c)      % ans = 3
%% 
% Element of A in 2nd row, 4th column:

A(2,4)      % ans = 0
%% 
% If only one argument is given for the index, Matlab will start counting at 
% the upper left corner and work down each *column* in sequence:

A(1)        % ans = 1
A(4)        % ans = 2
%% 
% We can change an individual matrix element:

A(2,4) = pi
%% 
% or change multiple elements at once:

A(1:2,2) = [-1; -1]
%% 
% Multiple elements can also be changed to a single scalar value:

A(2:3,3) = -100
%% 
% size() returns an array containing the number of rows and columns in a matrix:

[m,n] = size(A)     % m = 3, n = 4
%% 
% We previously used sum() to find the summation of all values in an array (vector).  
% When applied to a matrix, sum() will return the summation of values within each 
% *column* of the matrix:

sum(A)      
%% 
% Concatenating linear arrays into (longer) vectors or into rectangular arrays 
% (matrices)

x = [1 2 3];
y = [-3 -2 -1];

z = [x y]           % z = [1 2 3 -3 -2 -1]

A1 = [x
      y]            % A1 = [1 2 3; -3 -2 -1]

A2 = [x' y']        % A2 = [1 -3; 2 -2; 3 -1] 
%% 
% Recall colon notation to "pull out" a range of elements in a linear array:

x = [1 0 -1 2];
x(2:3)              % ans = [0 -1]
%% 
% Same notation can also be used for the row or column index (or both) in a 
% matrix.
% 
% Pull out elements in 1st and 2nd rows, 3rd and 4th columns:

A(1:2, 3:4)         % ans = [3 -1; 6 0]
%% 
% Pull out elements in 1st and 2nd rows, 2nd through 4th columns:

A(1:2, 2:4)         % ans = [2 3 -1; 5 6 0]
%% 
% A colon ":" by itself as an index means "all". Pull out all rows of the 2nd 
% column:

A(:,2)              % ans = [2; 5; 8]
%% 
% Pull out all the columns of the 2nd row:

A(2,:)              % ans = [4 5 6 0]
%% 
% Matrices may be "partitioned" into a set of rows or columns. Here is an example 
% of column partitioning:

C1 = A(:,1)
C2 = A(:,2)
C3 = A(:,3)
C4 = A(:,4)
%% 
% Now reconstruct the original matrix from the columns:

A = [C1 C2 C3 C4]
%% 
% We can also use row partitioning to break a matrix into rows (noting there 
% are only n=3 rows vs. m=4 columns for A):

R1 = A(1,:)
R2 = A(2,:)
R3 = A(3,:)

A = [ R1
      R2
      R3 ]
%% 
% Matrix partitioning is a key step to understanding how arithmetic operations 
% between matrices and vectors are defined.
% 
% 
% 
% *MATRIX-VECTOR MULTIPLICATION*
% 
% Given A is a matrix and x is a column vector, matrix-vector multiplication 
% (A*x) requires that x has the same number of elements as A has columns, i.e. 
% the inner dimensions of A and x must match.

A = [1 2 3 -1; 4 5 6 0; 7 8 9 1];   % A is 3x4
x = [-2; -1; 1];                    % x is 3x1
% A*x                 % ERROR (4 vs. 3 for inner dimensions)
%% 
% When the dimensional condition is satisfied, the resultant vector y=A*x will 
% be a column vector with the same number of elements as A has rows:

x = [-2; -1; 1; 2];
A*x                 % ans = [-3; -7; -11]
%% 
% The formal definition of the product can be given expressed as the *weighted 
% sum of the columns of A*
% 
% Remember, we defined above C1...C4 to be the respective columns of A, so let's 
% apply the weighted sum concept:


y = x(1)*C1 + x(2)*C2 + x(3)*C3 + x(4)*C4
%% 
% A*x can also be written as a vector consisting of the products of the *rows* 
% of A with the vector x:

y = [ R1*x
      R2*x
      R3*x ] 
%% 
% Both row and column expansions of the product are consistent and equivalent, 
% and lead to Matlab's reported result for the product A*x.  Matlab applies such 
% rules automatically when the multiplication is valid; you don't need to manually 
% apply the expansion (but be aware of it!)
% 
% 
% 
% *MATRIX-MATRIX MULTIPLICATION*
% 
% Define 2 matrices A and B

A = [1 2 3 -1
     4 5 6 0
     7 8 9 1];
 
B = [-1 0 1
     1 2 3];
%% 
% Note that A is 3x4, B is 2x3

% A*B         % ERROR (inner dimensions are different)
%% 
% Product A*B is not defined since inner dimensions don't match (4 vs 2)

B*A         % yields a 2x4 matrix result
%% 
% Product BA is defined since inner dimensions match (both are 3), and result 
% matrix is 2x4 (outer dimensions)

A = [1 2
     3 4
     5 6];   % 3x2 matrix

A*B                    % 3x2 * 2x3 --> 3x3
%% 
% Product is defined since inner dimensions match (both are 2). Result is 3x3 
% (outer dimensions)    

B*A         % 2x3 * 3x2 --> 2x2
%% 
% Product is also defined since inner dimensions also match, and result is 2x2.
% 
% Note from the three examples above that matrix multiplication is NOT COMMUTATIVE: 
% generally A*B is different from B*A. 
% 
% The row,column value resulting from matrix multiplication is given by the 
% product of the row from the 1st matrix and the column of the 2nd matrix:

AB = A*B;

AB(2,3)             % ans = 15
A(2,:) * B(:,3)     % ans = 15
%% 
% Similarly, ith column of C_AB = A*B is given by A * (ith column of B)

AB(:,2)         
A * B(:,2)
%% 
% Both these equivalent ways of viewing the matrix-matrix product give the same 
% results, and agree with Matlab's reported result for A*B
% 
% 
% 
% *Matrix transpose:*
% 
% A' turns the rows of A into columns, and vice-versa (just remember that if 
% your matrix contains imaginary numbers you will need to use .' instead of ' 
% for the non-conjugate transpose!)

A
A'
%% 
% 
% 
% *Identity matrix:*
% 
% The identity matrix is a square matrix (same number of rows and columns), 
% with "1" on the diagonal and "0" everywhere else:

I = [ 1 0 0
      0 1 0
      0 0 1 ]
%% 
% Identity matrices are equivalent to the number 1 in ordinary scalar arithmetic.  
% However, keep in mind that dimensions matter:

I*A         % 3x3 * 3x2 --> 2x2
% A*I         % 3x2 * 3x3 --> ERROR

% I*B         % 2x3 * 3x3 --> ERROR
B*I         % 2x3 * 2x3 --> 2x3
%% 
% Also true for vectors, assuming they are of correct size for multiplication

A2 = A(:,2)     % Second column of A

I*A2            % 3x3 * 3x1 --> 3x1
%% 
% We can easily generate identity matrices of any size using Matlab's "eye" 
% function

I = eye(4)      % 4x4 identity matrix
%% 
% Input to eye() is the desired array size (rows or cols)
% 
% If given a matrix as its input, the Matlab diag() function returns a column 
% array with only the diagonal elements of that matrix

diag(I)     % ans = [1; 1; 1; 1]

C = [1 0 1; 2 2 0; 3 1 5]
diag(C)     % ans = [1; 2; 5]
%% 
% diag() can also be used to *create* a square matrix If diag is given a (linear) 
% array as its input, it creates a square matrix with the elements of the array 
% on the diagonal, and zeros elsewhere.
% 
% This is an easy way to "strip" all but the diagonal elements from a matrix 
% (setting the others to 0):

C1 = diag(diag(C))
%% 
% As another example, use diag() to generate an identity matrix:

diag([1 1 1])
%% 
% 
% 
% *INVERSES OF SQUARE MATRICES*
% 
% Inverting a 2x2 matrix by hand is easy (assuming you've taken a Linear Algebra 
% course that is).  Inverting a 3x3 is not too bad. Inverting a 4x4, 5x5, ... 
% by hand is a nightmare!  Matlab makes this easy using the inv() function:

A = [1 2; 
     3 4]

inv(A)
%% 
% Product of matrix and its inverse is always the identity matrix:

A * inv(A)          % ans = [1 0; 0 1]

inv(A) * A          % ans = [1 0; 0 1]
%% 
% Let's look at a larger matrix

A2 = [ 1  2  3 
       4 -5  6
       9  8  7 ]

inv(A2)
%% 
% Inverse is not defined if the *determinant* of the matrix is zero such a matrix 
% is "singular" (again, stuff you'll learn in Linear Algebra).
% 
% det() calculates the determinant of a square matrix (any size):

A = [ 1 1
      3 3 ]

det(A)      % close to zero!

inv(A)      % {Warning: Matrix is singular to working precision.} 
%% 
% Determinant of A is zero here, so inverse is not defined!
% 
% Singluar matrices are the like the number zero in scalar arithmetic; they 
% do not have a defined inverse. More precisely, in scalar arithmetic, there is 
% no meaningful solution for x in the equation a*x = b when a=0 and b<>0 (and 
% if b=0, *any* numerical value for x will work!)
% 
% We can encounter, and solve, similar problems in matrix arithmetic, provided 
% the matrix square and nonsingular.
% 
% Solve A2*x = b for x:


b = [-1;0;1];
x = inv(A2)*b 

A2*x      % same as b since x is a solution of A2*x=b
%% 
% Multiplication by the inverse of a matrix can be simplified in Matlab using 
% the backslash (\) operator. For example, instead of "inv(A2) * b" we can say:

A2 \ b   % Note the order -- read from right to left!
