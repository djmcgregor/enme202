% Matlab understands complex values: 

sqrt(-4)    % ans = 0 + 2.0000i
%% 
% The result is shown in the standard "cartesian" or "rectangular" form for 
% a complex number: a+b*i, where a,b are real, and i is the "imaginary" number 
% whose square is -1.

i     % ans = 0 + 1.0000i
i^2   % ans = -1
%% 
% Matlab also understands complex number calculations like:

i^i
sin(i)
exp(i*pi)
%% 
% Engineers often use "j" instead of "i" for the "imaginary" number j^2 = -1.  
% While Matlab will always use i to display complex values, the definition for 
% j is also built in.

j     % ans = 0 + 1.0000i
j^2   % ans = -1
%% 
% Let's look at the quadratic formula again, but with coefficients that yield 
% complex roots:

a = 2; b = 4; c = 10;
x1 = (-b+sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a)     % x1 = -1.0000 + 2.0000i
x2 = (-b-sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a)     % x2 = -1.0000 - 2.0000i

%% 
% We can also directly define complex variables like:

z1 = -1 + 2*j
%% 
% Note: You don't need "*" before i or j when explicitly defining a complex 
% number (although you can, if you want to). This is the one (and only) situation 
% where Matlab will understand implied multiplication without explicitly using 
% "*".

z2 = -2 + 3.5j
%% 
% However, you can only use the "implicit multiply" with i or j if the thing 
% that precedes it is a real number (not just something that *evaluates* to a 
% real number)

(2+3)*i   % This is fine, but
% (2+3)i    % this is not
%% 
% You also can't use the "implied multiply" shorthand with variables:

c = 3;
c*i       % This is fine, but
% ci        % this is not
%% 
% The latter is not allowed since Matlab can't know if ci is meant to be a separate 
% variable name.
% 
% 
% 
% *Complex functions and operations*
% 
% The real() and imag() functions can be used to break a complex number into 
% its real and imaginary parts:

real(z1)    % Real part of a complex number
imag(z1)    % Imaginary part of a complex number
conj(z1)    % Complex conjugate
%% 
% Matlab knows how to do complex arithmetic:

z1 + z2
z1 - z2
z1 * z2
z3 = z1 / z2
%% 
% Just as an exercise/check, let's do the above division for z3 manually using 
% complex functions, without using complex arithmetic.
% 
% To divide two complex numbers, multiply top & bottom by the complex conjugate 
% of the denominator (z2):

z2c = conj(z2)                      % complex conjugate of z2
denom = real(z2)^2 + imag(z2)^2     % Denominator (always real)
numReal = real(z1)*real(z2c) - imag(z1)*imag(z2c)   % numerator (real)
numImag = real(z1)*imag(z2c) + imag(z1)*real(z2c)   % numerator (imag)
z3 = numReal/denom + j*numImag/denom    % z3 = z1/z2
%% 
% The result should be the same as typing z3 = z1/z2
% 
% Complex magnitude (absolute value)

abs(z1)
%% 
% The following statements are equivalent:

abs(z1)
sqrt(z1*conj(z1))
sqrt(real(z1)^2 + imag(z1)^2)
%% 
% Complex exponential function -- Euler's formula

theta = 3*pi/4      % pick an angle
exp(j*theta)        % A*exp(j*theta) = A*(cos(theta) + j*sin(theta))
%% 
% Use abs() and angle() to convert a complex number to polar form (magnitude 
% & angle):

z = -1+j
r = abs(z)
theta = angle(z)    % extract the angle
%% 
% Visualizing z on the complex plane, it is clear that theta should be 3*pi/4 
% = 135 deg:

theta * 180/pi    % should be 135 deg
%% 
% Now convert from polar to cartesian form using Euler's formula:

r * exp(j*theta)  % ans = -1.0000 + 1.0000i
%% 
% We could also do explicit rectangular conversion:

r*(cos(theta) + j*sin(theta))     % ans = -1.0000 + 1.0000i
%% 
% Careful with the polar angle! To find the angle given a complex number z, 
% you might be tempted to use:

theta = atan(imag(z)/real(z))
%% 
% Which yields -0.7854 = -pi/4, not the (correct) 3*pi/4 value.
% 
% The above atan() trig won't always work.  In this case, z is in the wrong 
% *quadrant* of the plane for a simple atan() calculation.  Looking at the planar 
% geometry/trig for this problem, we'd actually need to use the supplement of 
% this angle:

theta = atan(imag(z)/real(z)) + pi    % --> 2.3562 rad = 3*pi/4
%% 
% It is fairly common in planar geometry, when doing polar coordinate conversions, 
% to encounter such a problem.  Matlab, and most computer languages, have a built-in 
% "4 quadrant" atan function to handle it.
% 
% To get the correct polar angle for a point at coordinates (x,y) in the plane, 
% use *atan2(y,x)* 
% 
% Note there are *two* separate inputs, and note their order! Applied to a complex 
% number, the "x" coordinate is the real part, the "y" coordinate is the imag 
% part, so:

theta = atan2(imag(z), real(z))
%% 
% gives the right polar angle.
% 
% This 4 quadrant atan2() functionality is built into the angle() function for 
% complex numbers, without you needing to separate out real and imag parts.
% 
% Finally, note (again) that *all* Matlab's built-in functions can work with 
% complex numbers

sqrt(2j)    % ans = 1.0000 + 1.0000i
