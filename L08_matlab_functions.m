% Syntax for a custom function with single input & output values:
  % return_variable -->  local variable value returned by the function
  % function_name   -->  name of the function
  % arguments  -->  one of more values passed to the function
  %
  % Function code goes here...
  % 
  % Note that code in the function block is indented

end
%% 
% The function can be saved as a separate m-file with the same name as the function_name 
% itself. For example, the following function must be saved as "timestwo.m":
function z = timestwo(y)
  z = y*2; 
end
%% 
% Alternately, functions may be defined *at the end of an m-file*, with all 
% other code located above the function definition(s). Such functions are considered 
% "local", meaning that they can only be accessed by code within the same m-file 
% where the function is defined.
% 
% *Function overview:*
% 
% A function is a construct that takes one or more inputs (arguments), and returns 
% either nothing or a single value. Note that any type of value is allowed, including 
% arrays containing multiple values internal to the array data structure.
% 
% Let's look at the above function declaration line in detail:
function z = timestwo(y)
%% 
% This is the function declaration. This particular function takes a single 
% argument, i.e. a value that is passed to the function and assigned to the variable 
% name y within the function. A single value is returned by the function. This 
% value is whatever is stored in the local variable name z (see below for discussion 
% of local vs. global variables). Thus whatever value variable z holds at the 
% end of the function block is the value that will be returned to the calling 
% code.
% 
% *Variable scope:*
% 
% The workspace holds variables declared in our main code (as well as variables 
% declared directly in the command window). Variables in the workspace are *global*, 
% meaning that any normal code we run will have access to those variable names 
% and their corresponding values.
% 
% Variables defined in a function (like y and z above) reside in their own separate 
% workspaces.  These variables are *local* to each function, i.e. the variable 
% *scope* is limited to the function.
% 
% In fact, Matlab functions DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE GLOBAL WORKSPACE AT ALL. 
% Functions cannot normally access global variables, and the workspace cannot 
% access variables defined inside a function. As a result, the names used for 
% the input and output variables in a function are completely arbitrary. The workspace 
% never needs to know the names of these variables.  We could rewrite the above 
% function code as below, and it will work identically to the initial version 
% above:
function bar = timestwo(foo)
  bar = foo*2;  
end
%% 
% However, if we *explicitly declare a variable to be global*, functions can 
% access the variable from the main workspace and visa vera. Variables can be 
% declared to be global inside or outside of the function. Here is an example 
% with a variable declared global in the main code:
global a   % declare a to be global
a = 5;
function x = fn1(z)
  global a      % access global a
  x = 2*z*a;
  a = 10;       % modifying a will change its value globally
end
function y = fn2(z)
  global a      % access global a
  y = z*a/2;
end
%% 
% 
% 
% Below are some additional examples of functions that implement the quadratic 
% formula. To use the functions, either save each code block to a separate m-file 
% with a name matching the function,  i.e. quadform1.m, quadform2.m, quadform3.m 
% etc, or add the blocks to the end of a normal m-file containing code that calls 
% the functions.
% 
% quadform1.m :
function r = quadform1(a,b,c)
  % Re-implementation of quadform.m as a function.
  % Three coefficients of quadratic polynomial as inputs (a,b,c).
  % One output (r), which will be a vertical array of the two roots.
  x1 = (-b+sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a);
  x2 = (-b-sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a);
  r = [x1; x2];
end
%% 
% quadform2.m :
function r = quadform2(p)
  % Another implementation, here designed to take only
  % one input (a 3-element array) to more closely match
  % the operation of the built-in "roots" function
  a = p(1);
  b = p(2);
  c = p(3);
  x1 = (-b+sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a);
  x2 = (-b-sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a);
  r = [x1; x2];
end
%% 
% quadform3.m :
function [x1,x2] = quadform3(a,b,c)
  % Yet another implementation designed to output
  % the two roots separately, instead of together
  % in a single array as in the previous two examples
  %
  % This function has two separate outputs, similar to 
  % the max/min commands we have used.  The first will be 
  % x1, the second will be x2
  x1 = (-b+sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a);
  x2 = (-b-sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a);
  
end

% *Function handles:*
% 
% At the start of this topic, we said that functions must either be defined 
% in a separate m-file or placed at the end of the m-file where the function is 
% called. This is not quite true. Matlab supports the concept of "function handles", 
% allowing simple in-line functions to be defined within any m-file (this is similar 
% to the concept of "lambda functions" in Python, for those familiar with that 
% language).
% 
% Here is an example:
f = @(x,y) (x.^2 - y.^2);
%% 
% The @(x,y) syntax indicates the local variables defined within the function 
% to hold values passed to the function (two in the above case, but there could 
% be none, or many).  The expression in parentheses at the end of the line defines 
% the value that will be returned by the function. So:
f(-1,9)          % returns (-1)^2 - (9)^2 = -80
f([1 2],[3 4])   % returns [1 2].^2 - [3 4].^2 = [1 4] - [9 16] = [-8 -12]
%%
