% Polynomials can be represented in Matlab by arrays of coefficients, starting 
% with the highest power of x.
% 
% For example, the following array can be used to represent  p(x) = 2x^3 + 8x^2 
% + 12x + 8:

p = [2 8 12 8];
%% 
% polyval() evaluates a polynomial at a specified point, i.e. for a specific 
% numerical value of the independent variable:

polyval(p, 0)     % evaluate p(x) @ x=0

polyval(p, 2.15)  % evaluate p(x) @ x=2.15
%% 
% Just to verify Matlab's answer manually:

x = 2.15;
2*x^3 + 8*x^2 + 12*x + 8
%% 
% In the previous example, x was a single value, but polyval can also evaluate 
% the polynomial across an entire array of points:

x = -3:.1:3;
polyval(p, x)     % returns an array with length(x) values
%% 
% Of course, we could do the same thing with regular Matlab array arithmetic:

2*x.^3 + 8*x.^2 + 12*x + 8
%% 
% The REAL reason for using Matlab's polynomial representation is that you can 
% use a host of other polynomial functions. Let's check some of those out.
% 
% 
% 
% *ROOTS* 

p = [1 0 0 0 -1]
%% 
% p is the array for the polynomial p(x) = x^4 - 1
% 
% Note that coefficients of "missing" powers of x are represented by zeros in 
% the appropriate position of the coefficient array.
% 
% The *roots()* function will find the roots (zeros) of an arbitrary order polynomial.  
% Since there are as many roots as the order of p (highest power of x), roots() 
% will return an *array* with all the roots:

r = roots(p)     % +/-1, +/-i (4 roots)  
%% 
% Try with our earlier polynomial:

p = [2 8 12 8];  % 3rd order polynomial (4 elements)
r = roots(p)     % 3 roots: -2, -1+/-i 
%% 
% Since the roots function finds roots numerically, evaluating the polynomial 
% at each root produces a number close, but not equal, to 0 due to numerical error!

polyval(p, r(1))      % ans = -1.5987e-014
%% 
% 
% 
% *POLYNOMIAL ARITHMETIC*
% 
% Polynomial addition and subtraction is equivalent to adding/subtracting the 
% coefficients of each array (but arrays must be same length!):

p1 = [1 2 3];     % p1(x) = x^2+2x+3
p2 = [3 1];       % p2(x) = 3x+1
% p3 = p1 + p2;     % Won't work -- arrays are different lengths
%% 
% Need to "pad" the shorter coefficient array with leading zeros to make it 
% the same length as the longer array in order to enable addition/subtraction: 

p2 = [0 3 1];     % p2(x) = 0x^2 + 3x + 1 
p3 = p1 + p2      % works!
%% 
% Polynomial multiplication:

p1 = [3 4 8]            % p1(x) = 3x^2 + 4x + 8
p2 = [2 0 0 0 0 1]      % p2(x) = 2x^5 + 1
% p1 * p2                 % ERROR: Inner matrix dimensions must agree
%% 
% Uh oh...what went wrong?
% 
% Polynomial multiplication is much more complicated than addition. Matlab has 
% a special function called *conv()* (convolution) for polynomial multiplication:

conv(p1,p2)
%% 
% Note that no padding is needed for conv()
% 
% Above is the coefficient array for the product of (2x^5+1) * (3x^2+4x+8), 
% which you can verify is correct by longhand calculation if you are particularly 
% masochistic.
% 
% 
% 
% *BUILDING A POLYNOMIAL FROM ITS ROOTS*

p = [2 8 12 8];     % Our original polynomial
r = roots(p)        % --> -2, -1+/-i
%% 
% What if we were given the roots, and needed to find the corresponding polynomial?
% 
% We could use the roots to assemble the polynomial in its factored form by 
% multiplying together all N of the first order factors (x-r(k)), where k = 1, 
% 2, ..., N.
% 
% Let's start with the just two roots (since conv only takes two arguments):

p1 = conv([1 -r(1)],[1 -r(2)])
%% 
% Then multiply the third polynomial by the result of the first product stored 
% in the variable (here pt):

p2 = conv(p1,[1 -r(3)])        % ans = [1 4 6 4]
%% 
% Check against original polynomial:

p    % [2 8 12 8] = 2 * p2
%% 
% Note that the original polynomial isn't "monic", so we need to multiply the 
% product of the factors by the coef of the highest power of x to recover the 
% original polynomial:

2 * p2    % ans = [2 8 12 8]
%% 
% We could also nest multiple conv() functions to accomplish the above in a 
% single line:

2 * conv( conv([1 -r(1)], [1 -r(2)]), [1 -r(3)])
%% 
% Ok, well that was a lot of work!!  Now, let's do it the easy way using *poly()*.
% 
% poly() is a built-in command to expand a polynomial as the product of its 
% first-order factors:

pp = poly(r)    % pp = [1 4 6 4]
%% 
% Same (monic) result as we got from conv above, but with a single function 
% call.  Very convenient!
% 
% 
% 
% *POLYNOMIAL CURVE FITTING*
% 
% Matlab can create a polynomial to fit a data set based on a least squares 
% algorithm.  Before investigating this, let's talk about saving and loading Matlab 
% data files using the save() and load() functions:
%% 
% * *save(filename)*   --> save current workspace variables to the named file
% * *load(filename)*   --> load vaiables from named file to current workspace
%% 
% Let's load two array variables from a file called sunspots.txt. This is a 
% text file containing two columns: column 1 = observation year, and column 2 
% = average monthly number of sunspots observed.

load('sunspots.txt', 'ascii')         % sunspots.txt must be in current path  
%% 
% The "ascii" part of this function tells Matlab to load the data from a plain 
% ASCII text file.  After loading, there will be a new workspace variable with 
% the same name as the file name (sunspots), which is an array containing the 
% two data columns from the file:

sunspots
%% 
% Break 'sunspots' up into two separate variables for easier manipulation:

year = sunspots(:,1);   % slice 1st column
spots = sunspots(:,2);  % slice 2nd column

plot(year, spots)
%% 
% Let's look only at the data since 1980. An easy way to do this is with the 
% find() function:

idx = find(year==1980);   % returns a single index
year = year(idx:end);
spots = spots(idx:end);
%% 
% ...or an alternate version of find():

indices = find(year>=1980);   % returns an array of indices
year = year(indices);
spots = spots(indices);
%% 
% Plot the result:

plot(year, spots, 'o-')
xlabel('Year')
ylabel('# of sunspots')
%% 
% Now let's fit a polynominal curve to the data. The *polyfit()* function returns 
% an array of coefficients for the polynomial that best fits the given data by 
% minimimzing the square of the error between the polynomial and data values (least 
% squares method).
% 
% The polyfit() fuction takes 3 arguments:
%% 
% # x coordinates of data
% # y coordinates of data
% # order of the polynomial to fit
%% 
% First, let's convert the year to a relative year (since 1980). The reason 
% for this will be explained shortly:

delta_year = year - min(year);
pp = polyfit(delta_year, spots, 3);
%% 
% Recall that polyval() converts a polynomial to an array of y-axis values for 
% a given array of x-values. Let's use this to evaluate the polynomial against 
% the original x data coordinates to see how well the function fits the data:

hold on
fit = polyval(pp, delta_year);
plot(year, fit, 'r-')
%% 
% Not very well here for a third order poly, so try a higher order:

pp = polyfit(delta_year, spots, 5);
fit = polyval(pp, delta_year);
plot(year, fit, 'k--')
%% 
% Even higher order:

pp = polyfit(delta_year, spots, 12);  
fit = polyval(pp, delta_year);
plot(year, fit, 'bx')
%% 
% The resulting 12th order polynomial is "ill conditioned", meaning that in 
% the calculation of the polynomial there was an operation that involved a near-singular 
% matrix (a matrix close to not having an inverse). This is not necessarily a 
% problem, but it is important to check the result to make sure the fit is acceptable.
% 
% What would have happened if we used the *absolute* year instead of the relative 
% year?

clf
pp = polyfit(year, spots, 5);
plot(year,spots)
hold on
plot(year,polyval(pp,year),'b:')
%% 
% What happened?   The polynomial is trying to fit data far from the origin, 
% without any intervening data to "guide" the fit, resulting in a poor fit.
% 
% 
% 
% *POLYNOMIAL DIVISION*
% 
% Like polynomial multiplication, Matlab can also do polynomial division using 
% the *deconv()* function.
% 
% Note that in general:
% 
% p1(x)/p2(x) = q(x) + r(x)/p2(x)
% 
% q(x) is the "quotient" polynomial
% 
% r(x) is the "remainder" polynomial

p1 = [2 6 8 4];           % p1(x) = 2x^3+6x^2+8x+4 
p2 = [1 2 2];             % p2(x) = x^2+2x+2
[q,r] = deconv(p1,p2) 
%% 
% If you do this by hand, you should find that
% 
% p1(x)/p2(x) = x+4 with remainder -2x-4
% 
% So in Matlab, q(x) = x+4 for this problem, and r(x) = -2x-4
% 
% Given q,r we can reconstruct the original polynomial as:
% 
% p1(x) = q(x)*p2(x) + r(x)
% 
% Note that r is automatically padded to the correct length so that we can reconstruct 
% the original (p1) polynomial from:

conv(q, p2) + r      % ans = [1 6 8 4] 
%% 
% A different example:

p2 = [1 1];      % p2 = x + 1
[q,r] = deconv(p1, p2) % x^3+6x^2+8x+4 / x+1
conv(q, p2) + r        % same quotient as above but new remainder

%% 
% 
% 
% A note about Matlab data files:
% 
% The above year & spot data were loaded from a text file (ascii format containing 
% values separated by white space or commas).  However, data can also be saved 
% in a '.mat' data file, which may be in a custom format defined by Matlab via 
% the "save workspace" command.  
% 
% Use the "load" command to load data from a .mat file (the extension may be 
% ommitted).  For example, if you have a file called mydata.mat, load the data 
% as:
% 
% load('mydata')
% 
% or
% 
% load mydata
% 
% A new variable called mydata will be created automatically.
% 
% When loading plain ascii text data, give the full file name (with extension), 
% and add '-ascii' to the load command:
% 
% load('mydata.txt', '-ascii')
%
